Overview
========

Some parallel execution environments execute threads in groups that allow
efficient communication within each group. Notably this is the case for
whole-program vectorization environments such as GPUs, where threads are mapped
to lanes of a SIMD vector. Efficient communication among threads is possible in
this case by simply exchanging data between the lanes of a vector. However, the
semantics defined in this document are independent of such implementation
details.

When control flow diverges, i.e. threads of the same group follow different
paths through the CFG, not all threads of the group may be available to
participate in this communication. This is the defining characteristic that
distinguishes convergent operations from other inter-thread communication and
which requires the use of the ``convergent`` attribute to indicate
*additional constraints* on program transforms:

A convergent operation involves inter-thread communication outside of the
memory model, where the set of threads which participate in communication is
implicitly affected by control flow.

For example, in the following GPU compute kernel, communication during the
convergent operation is expected to occur precisely among those threads of an
implementation-defined execution scope (such as workgroup or subgroup) for
which ``condition`` is true:

.. code-block:: c++

  void example_kernel() {
      ...
      if (condition)
          convergent_operation();
      ...
  }

In structured programming languages, there is often an intuitive and
unambiguous way of determining the threads that are expected to communicate.
However, this is not always the case even in structured programming languages,
and the intuition breaks down entirely in unstructured control flow. This
document describes the formal semantics in LLVM, i.e. how to determine the set
of communicating threads for convergent operations.

The definitions in this document leave many details open, such as how groups of
threads are formed in the first place. It focuses on the questions that are
relevant for deciding the correctness of generic program transforms and
convergence-related analyses such as divergence analysis.

Note: It is common among practicioners to think about convergent operations in
terms of *divergence* and *reconvergence*: sets of threads split at branch
instructions if threads follow different paths through the control flow graph
(divergence) and may later merge when they reach the same static point in the
program (reconvergence). This operational point of view is often convenient for
backend implementations and it can sometimes be useful for guiding intuition.
However, the semantics defined here are declarative, since experience has shown
that the operational view is too restrictive in practice for general compiler
transforms. It is up to each implementation to operationalize those declarative
semantics in a way that makes sense for the underlying hardware, which varies
wildly.


Motivating Examples of Convergent Operations
============================================

(This section is informative.)

Texture sampling in a pixel shader
----------------------------------

The following stylized pixel shader samples a texture at a given set of
coordinates. Texture sampling requires screen-space derivatives of the
coordinates to determine the level of detail (mipmap level) of the sample.
They are commonly approximated by taking the difference between neighboring
pixels, which are computed by different threads in the same group:

.. code-block:: c++

  void example_shader() {
    ...
    color = textureSample(texture, coordinates);
    if (condition) {
      use(color);
    }
    ...
  }

From a purely single-threaded perspective, sinking the `textureSample` into
the if-statement appears legal. However, if the condition is false for some
neighboring pixels, then their corresponding threads will not execute together
in the group, making it impossible to take the difference of coordinates as an
approximation of the screen-space derivative. In practice, the outcome will be
an undefined value.

That is, the `textureSample` operation fits our definition of a convergent
operation:

 1. It communicates with a set of threads that implicitly depends on control
    flow.

 2. Correctness depends on this set of threads.

The compiler frontend can emit IR that expresses the convergence constraints as
follows:

.. code-block:: llvm

  define void @example_shader() convergent {
    %entry = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry()
    ...
    %color = call T @textureSample(U %texture, V %coordinates) [ "convergencectrl"(token %entry) ]
    br i1 %condition, label %then, label %end

  then:
    call void @use(T %color)
    br label %end

  end:
  }

The :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.entry <llvm.experimental.convergence.entry>`
intrinsic is itself ``convergent``, and we expect it to communicate at least
among all threads of the same "quad" -- a group of 2x2 pixels that are
evaluated together for the purpose of approximating screen-space derivatives.
This fact is not part of the generic LLVM IR semantics: it would have to be
defined somewhere else, for example as part of target-specific ABI definitions
and/or in reference to some relevant API specs.

Since the ``@textureSample`` call then uses the token produced by the entry
intrinsic in its ``convergencectrl`` bundle, and has no additional control
dependencies, it must communicate among the same set of threads. This indicates
to generic program transforms that sinking the ``@textureSample`` call is
forbidden. (A program transform can still sink the call if it can prove somehow,
e.g. by leaning on target-specific callbacks that can analyze the program with
additional knowledge, that ``%condition`` is always uniform across the threads
referenced by the *convergence token* ``%entry``.)

.. _convergence_example_reductions:

Reductions inside divergent control flow
----------------------------------------

The following example shows that merging common code of branches can be
incorrect in the face of convergent operations:

.. code-block:: c++

  void example_kernel() {
    delta = ...
    if (delta > 0) {
      total_gains = subgroupAdd(delta);
      ...
    } else {
      total_losses = subgroupAdd(delta);
      ...
    }
  }

The ``subgroupAdd`` computing the ``total_gains`` will be executed by the
subset of threads with positive ``delta`` in a subgroup (wave), and so will sum
up all the ``delta`` values of those threads; and similarly for the
``subgroupAdd`` that computes the ``total_losses``.

If we were to hoist and merge the ``subgroupAdd`` above the if-statement, it
would sum up the ``delta`` across *all* threads instead.

The compiler frontend can emit IR that expresses the convergence constraints
as follows:

.. code-block:: llvm

  define void @example_kernel() convergent {
    %entry = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry()
    %delta = ...
    %cc = icmp sgt i32 %delta, 0
    br i1 %cc, label %then, label %else

  then:
    %total_gains = call i32 @subgroupAdd(i32 %delta) [ "convergencectrl"(token %entry) ]
    ...
    br label %end

  else:
    %total_losses = call i32 @subgroupAdd(i32 %delta) [ "convergencectrl"(token %entry) ]
    ...
    br label %end

  end:
    ...
  }

The entry intrinsic behaves like in the previous example: assuming that
``@example_kernel`` is an OpenCL kernel (as hinted at by the "subgroup"
terminology), we expect it to communicate among all threads within the
"subgroup". This typically maps to a SIMD vector on GPU hardware.

The calls to ``@subgroupAdd`` use the token produced by the entry intrinsic,
but they also have an additional control dependency. According to the rules
defined in this document, they only communicate among the subset of threads
that actually end up executing the respective (static) call site.

Hoisting them would remove the control dependency and cause them to communicate
among the full set of threads that the entry intrinsic communicated with.
Again, hoisting is allowed if it can be proven that ``%cc`` is always uniform
among the relevant set of threads: in that case, the ``@subgroupAdd`` already
communicates among the full set of threads in the original program.


Unstructured control flow
-------------------------

Consider an example of how jump threading removes structure in a way that can
make semantics non-obvious:

.. code-block:: llvm

  void example_original() {
  entry:
      ...
      br i1 %cond1, label %then1, label %mid

  then1:
      ...
      %cond2 = ...
      br label %mid

  mid:
      %flag = phi i1 [ true, %entry ], [ %cond2, %then1 ]
      br i1 %flag, label %then2, label %end

  then2:
      ...
      call void @subgroupControlBarrier()
      ...
      br label %end

  end:
  }

  void example_jumpthreaded() {
  entry:
      br i1 %cond1, label %then1, label %then2

  then1:
      ...
      %cond2 = ...
      br i1 %cond2, label %then2, label %end

  then2:
      ...
      call void @subgroupControlBarrier()
      ...
      br label %end

  end:
  }

Is the control barrier guaranteed to synchronize among the same set of threads
in both cases? Different implementations in the literature may give different
answers to this question:

* In an implementation that reconverges at post-dominators, threads reconverge
  at ``mid`` in the first version, so that all threads (within a subgroup/wave)
  that execute the control barrier do so together. In the second version,
  threads that reach the control barrier via different paths synchronize
  separately: the first (and only) post-dominator is ``end``, so threads do not
  reconverge before then.

* An implementation that sorts basic blocks topologically and ensures maximal
  reconvergence for each basic block would behave the same way in both
  versions.

We generally take the stance that reconvergence in acyclic control flow must
be maximal. The compiler frontend could augment the original code as follows:

.. code-block:: llvm

  define void @example_original() convergent {
  entry:
    %entry = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry()
    ...
    br i1 %cond1, label %then1, label %mid

  then1:
    ...
    %cond2 = ...
    br label %mid

  mid:
    %flag = phi i1 [ true, %entry ], [ %cond2, %then1 ]
    br i1 %flag, label %then2, label %end

  then2:
    ...
    call void @subgroupControlBarrier() [ "convergencectrl"(token %entry) ]
    ...
    br label %end

  end:
  }

If S is the set of threads that the entry intrinsic communicated with, then
the ``@subgroupControlBarrier`` call communicates with the subset of S that
actually reaches the call site. This set of threads doesn't change after
jump-threading, so the answer to the question posed above remains the same.


Opportunistic convergent operations
-----------------------------------

Some programs have local regions of code that contain a sequence of convergent
operations where the code does not care about the exact set of threads with
which it is executed, but only that the set of threads is the same for all the
operations within the sequence. (If a subset of the convergent operations in
the sequence have additional, non-uniform control dependencies, then this is
not possible. However, the code may still require that the sets of threads are
logically consistent with the conditions of those control dependencies.)
In this case,
:ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor <llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor>`
can be used to express the desired semantics.

The following example function could be part of a hypothetical "append buffer"
implementation, where threads conditionally write fixed-sized records
contiguously into a global buffer. The function ``@reserveSpaceInBuffer``
returns the index into the buffer at which the calling thread should store its
data.

This could be achieved by using a simple atomic operation in every thread to
bump an allocation counter.

However, the following implementation can be more performant on some hardware,
because it uses only a single atomic operation for an entire group of threads.
To do this, it first determines the total size of the group, which will be the
operand to the atomic operation, and then later broadcasts the result of the
atomic operation to all threads of the group, so that each thread can compute
its individual position in the buffer:

.. code-block:: llvm

  define i32 @reserveSpaceInBuffer() {    ; NOTE: _not_ a convergent function!
  entry:
    %anchor = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()

    %ballot = call i64 @subgroupBallot(i1 true) [ "convergencectrl"(token %anchor) ]
    %numThreads.p = call i64 @llvm.ctpop.i64(i64 %ballot)
    %numThreads = trunc i64 %numThreads.p to i32

    %absoluteThreadIdx = call i32 @getSubgroupLocalInvocationId()
    %absoluteThreadIdx.ext = zext i32 %absoluteThreadIdx to i64
    %mask.p = shl i64 1, %absoluteThreadIdx.ext
    %mask = sub i64 %mask.p, 1

    %maskedBallot = and i64 %ballot, %mask
    %relativeThreadIdx.p = call i64 @llvm.ctpop.i64(i64 %maskedBallot)
    %relativeThreadIdx = trunc i64 %relativeThreadIdx.p to i32

    %isFirstThread = icmp eq i32 %relativeThreadIdx, 0
    br i1 %isFirstThread, label %then, label %end

  then:
    %baseOffset.1 = atomicrmw add i32* @bufferAllocationCount, i32 %numThreads monotonic
    br label %end

  end:
    %baseOffset.2 = phi i32 [ undef, %entry ], [ %baseOffset.1, %then ]
    %baseOffset = call i32 @subgroupBroadcastFirst(i32 %baseOffset.2) [ "convergencectrl"(token %anchor) ]
    %offset = add i32 %baseOffset, %relativeThreadIdx
    ret i32 %offset
  }

The key here is that the function really doesn't care which set of threads it
it is being called with. It takes whatever set of threads it can get. What the
implementation of the function cares about is that the initial
``@subgroupBallot`` -- which is used to retrieve the bitmask of threads that
executed the anchor together -- executes with the same set of threads as the
final ``@subgroupBroadcastFirst``. Nothing else is required for correctness as
far as convergence is concerned.

The function ``@reserveSpaceInBuffer`` itself is _not_ ``convergent``: callers
are free to move call sites of the function as they see fit. This can change
the behavior in practice, by changing the sets of threads that are grouped
together for the atomic operation. This can be visible in the output of the
program, since the order in which outputs appear in the buffer is changed.
However, this does not break the overall contract that ``@reserveSpaceInBuffer``
has with its caller -- which makes sense: the order of outputs is
non-deterministic anyway because of the atomic operation that is involved.

If the function is inlined, the use of the anchor intrinsic similarly indicates
that certain transforms which are usually forbidden by the presence of
convergent operations are in fact allowed, as long as they don't break up the
region of code that is controlled by the anchor.


.. _dynamic_instances_and_convergence_tokens:

Dynamic Instances and Convergence Tokens
========================================

Every execution of an LLVM IR instruction occurs in a *dynamic instance* of
the instruction. Dynamic instances are the formal objects by which we talk
about communicating threads in convergent operations. They satisfy:

1. Different executions of the same instruction by a single thread
   give rise to different dynamic instances of that instruction.

2. Executions of different instructions always occur in different dynamic
   instances. For this and other rules in this document, instructions of the
   same type at different points in the program are considered to be different
   instructions.

3. Executions of the same instruction by different threads may occur in
   the same dynamic instance.

4. When executing a convergent operation, the set of threads that execute the
   same dynamic instance is the set of threads that communicate with each other
   for that operation.

*Convergence tokens* are values of ``token`` type, i.e. they cannot be used in
``phi`` or ``select`` instructions. A convergence token value represents the
dynamic instance of the instruction that produced it.

Convergent operations typically have a ``convergencectrl`` operand bundle with
a convergence token operand to define the set of communicating threads relative
to some anchor. The details are described in the
:ref:`Formal Rules <convergence_formal_rules>` section.

The convergence control intrinsics described in this document and convergent
operations that have a ``convergencectrl`` operand bundle are considered
*controlled* convergent operations.

Other convergent operations are *uncontrolled*. Their use is deprecated.
Program transforms are correct for uncontrolled convergent operations if they
do not make such operations control-dependent on additional values. The
remainder of this document is only concerned with controlled convergent
operations.

Informational notes:

1. The rules above define dynamic instances for *all* LLVM IR instructions,
   whether convergent or not. However, the dynamic instances for non-convergent
   instructions are entirely irrelevant. The only way that dynamic instances
   can have an effect on the execution of a program is via rule 4 about the
   cross-thread communication in convergent operatons.

2. The text defines convergence token values as representing a dynamic
   instance, but you could almost think of them as representing a set of
   threads instead -- specifically, the set S of threads that executed the
   dynamic instance, i.e. that executed the defining instruction D "together".

   Intuitively, when a convergence token value T is used by a
   ``convergencectrl`` bundle on an instruction I, then the set of threads that
   communicates in I is a subset of the set S represented by the token value.
   Specifically, it is the subset of threads that ends up executing I while
   using the token value.

   This by itself wouldn't quite work as a definition: what if I is executed
   multiple times by the same threads? Which execution of I in thread 1
   communicates with which execution of I in thread 2? Leaning on the notion of
   dynamic instances gives a robust answer to this question as long as D and I
   are at the same loop (or cycle) nesting level.

   The case where D and I are at different loop nesting levels is forbidden by
   the static validity rules spelled out in the
   :ref:`Formal Rules <convergence_formal_rules>` section -- handling that case
   is the purpose of
   :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.loop <llvm.experimental.convergence.loop>`.


Convergence Control Intrinsics
==============================

This section describes target-independent intrinsics that can be used to
produce convergence tokens.

.. _llvm.experimental.convergence.entry:

``llvm.experimental.convergence.entry``
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: llvm

  token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry() convergent readnone

This intrinsic is used to tie the dynamic instances inside of a function to
those in the caller. Informally, one can think of it as returning the
convergence token value that was used in the ``convergencectrl`` operand bundle
when the current function was called. The formal definition based on dynamic
instances is given :ref:`later <convergence_formal_rules_entry>`.

Behavior is undefined if the containing function was called from IR without
a ``convergencectrl`` bundle.

The expectation is that for program "main" functions whose caller is not
visible to LLVM, such as kernel entry functions, the implementation returns a
convergence token that represents uniform control flow, i.e. that is guaranteed
to refer to all threads within a (target- or environment-dependent) group.

Behavior is undefined if this intrinsic appears in a function that isn't
``convergent``.

Behavior is undefined if this intrinsic appears inside of another
:ref:`convergence region <convergence_region>` or outside of a function's entry
block.

Function inlining substitutes this intrinsic with the token from the operand
bundle. For example:

.. code-block:: c++

  // Before inlining:

  void callee() convergent {
    %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry()
    convergent_operation(...) [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  }

  void main() {
    %outer = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    for (...) {
      %inner = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %outer) ]
      callee() [ "convergencectrl"(token %inner) ]
    }
  }

  // After inlining:

  void main() {
    %outer = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    for (...) {
      %inner = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %outer) ]
      convergent_operation(...) [ "convergencectrl"(token %inner) ]
    }
  }


.. _llvm.experimental.convergence.loop:

``llvm.experimental.convergence.loop``
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: llvm

  token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token) ] convergent readnone

This intrinsic defines the *heart* of a loop, i.e. the place where an imaginary
loop counter is incremented for the purpose of determining convergence
semantics.

The convergence control token operand is usually defined outside of the loop,
but this is not a requirement for the validity of a program (the resulting
behavior is quite different, though).

The resulting convergence token *can* be used outside of the loop; see the
:ref:`Formal Rules <convergence_formal_rules>` section for details.


.. _llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor:

``llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor``
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: llvm

  token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor() convergent readnone

This intrinsic is a marker that acts as an *anchor* producing an initial
convergence token that is independent from any "outer scope". The set of
threads executing the same dynamic instance of this intrinsic is
implementation-defined.

The expectation is that all threads within a group that "happen to be active at
the same time" will execute the same dynamic instance, so that programs can
detect the maximal set of threads that can communicate efficiently within
some local region of the program.


.. _convergence_formal_rules:

Formal Rules
============

The convergence control intrinsics described in the previous section place
additional constraints on the execution of dynamic instances, which should be
understood on top of the
:ref:`basic rules about dynamic instances <dynamic_instances_and_convergence_tokens>`:

1. Let U be a controlled convergent operation other than
   :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.loop <llvm.experimental.convergence.loop>`
   whose convergence token is produced by an instruction D. Two threads
   executing U execute the same dynamic instance of U if and only if they
   obtained the token value from the same dynamic instance of D.

   (Informational note: As mentioned in the
   :ref:`basic rules about dynamic instances <dynamic_instances_and_convergence_tokens>`,
   the requirement here is that U is the same point in the program and not just
   the same type of instruction. In particular, this rule does not apply when
   the same ``convergent`` function is called from different call sites.)

2. Two threads executing the same call U of
   :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.loop <llvm.experimental.convergence.loop>`
   execute the same dynamic instance of U if and only if:

     1. They obtained the ``convergencectrl`` token operand value from the same
        dynamic instance of the defining instruction, and
     2. There is an *n* such that both threads execute U for the *n*'th time
        with that same token operand value.

.. _convergence_formal_rules_entry:

3. If two threads execute the same call U of
   :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.entry <llvm.experimental.convergence.entry>`,
   and at least one of them executes the function F containing U because it was
   called by a ``call``, ``invoke``, or ``callbr`` instruction, then they
   execute the same dynamic instance of U if and only if both threads execute F
   because it was called by the same dynamic instance of a ``call``, ``invoke``,
   or ``callbr`` instruction.

   Informational notes:

     1. If a thread executes the function due to a call from IR, then the
        thread cannot "spontaneously converge" with threads that execute the
        function for some other reason.

     2. The behavior of ``llvm.experimental.convergence.entry`` in functions
        that are called from outside the scope of LLVM, e.g. kernel entry
        point functions, is expected to be defined elsewhere, e.g. in reference
        to the relevant language or API (e.g. OpenCL, Vulkan) specifications.

For the purpose of the following rules, a *cycle* is a walk in the CFG, i.e.
a directed sequence of nodes and edges in the CFG, whose start and end points
are the same.

The following static rules about cycles must be satisfied by valid programs:

1. Every cycle in the CFG that contains a use of a convergence token T other
   than a use by
   :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.loop <llvm.experimental.convergence.loop>`
   must also contain the definition of T.

2. Every cycle in the CFG that contains two or more static uses of a
   convergence token T by
   :ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.loop <llvm.experimental.convergence.loop>`
   must also contain the definition of T.

.. _convergence_region:

The *convergence region* of a convergence token T is the minimal region in
which T is live and used, i.e., the set of program points dominated by the
definition D of T from which a use of T can be reached by a walk in the CFG
that is fully dominated by D.

The following static rule about convergence regions must be satisfied by
valid programs:

1. If a convergence region R for a token T1 contains a use of a convergence
   token T2, then R must also contain the definition of T2. (In other words,
   convergence regions must be reasonably nested.)


Memory Model Non-Interaction
============================

The fact that an operation is convergent has no effect on how it is treated for
memory model purposes. In particular, an operation that is ``convergent`` and
``readnone`` does not introduce additional ordering constraints as far as the
memory model is concerned. There is no implied barrier, neither in the memory
barrier sense nor in the control barrier sense of synchronizing the execution
of threads.

Informational note: Threads that execute the same dynamic instance do not
necessarily do so at the same time.


Other Interactions
==================

``convergent`` vs. ``speculatable``. A function can be both ``convergent`` and
``speculatable``, indicating that the function does not have undefined
behavior and has no effects besides calculating its result, but is still
affected by the set of threads executing this function. This typically
prevents speculation of calls to the function unless the constraint imposed
by ``convergent`` is further relaxed by some other means.


Rationales
==========

(This section is informative.)

Static rules about cycles
-------------------------

Consider a loop with (incorrect!) convergence control as in the following
pseudocode:

.. code-block:: llvm

  ; WARNING: Example of incorrect convergence control!

  %anchor = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  for (;;) {
    ...
    call void @convergent.op() [ "convergencectrl"(token %anchor) ]
    ...
  }

This code is forbidden by the first static rule about cycles.

A first formal argument why we have to do this is that the dynamic rule for
deciding whether two threads execute the same dynamic instances of
``@convergent.op`` leads to a logical contradiction in this code.
Assume two threads execute the same dynamic instance of the anchor
followed by two iterations of the loop. Thread 1 executes dynamic instances
I1 and I2 of ``@convergent.op``, thread 2 executes dynamic instances J1 and J2.
Using all the rules, we can deduce:

1. ``I1 != I2`` and ``J1 != J2`` by the basic rules of dynamic instances.

2. ``I1 == J1`` by the first dynamic rule about controlled convergent
   operations: both threads execute the same static instruction while using
   a convergence token value produced by the same dynamic instance of an
   instruction (the anchor).

3. ``I1 == J2`` by the same argument. Also, ``I2 == J1`` and ``I2 == J2``.

   The fact that one may be *intuitively* tempted to think of ``I1`` and ``J2``
   as being executed in different loop iterations is completely irrelevant for
   the *formal* argument. There is no mechanism in LLVM IR semantics for
   forming associations between loop iterations in different threads, *except*
   for the rules defined in this document -- and the rules in this document
   require a loop heart intrinsic for talking about loop iterations.

4. By transitivity, we have ``I1 == I2`` and ``J1 == J2``. That is a
   contradiction.

This problem goes away by inserting a loop heart intrinsic, which establishes
a relationship between loop iterations across threads.

One may ask whether we could change the dynamic rule instead of adding the
static rule about cycles. That is impractical due to deeper difficulties.
Consider the following loop, again with incorrect convergence control:

.. code-block:: llvm

  ; WARNING: Example of incorrect convergence control!

  ; (A)
  %anchor = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  for (;;) {
    ; (B)
    if (condition1) {
      ; (C)
      call void @convergent.op.1() [ "convergencectrl"(token %anchor) ]
    }
    ; (D)
    if (condition2) {
      ; (E)
      call void @convergent.op.2() [ "convergencectrl"(token %anchor) ]
    }
    ; (F)
  }
  ; (G)

Assume two threads execute the same dynamic instance of the anchor followed
by this sequence of basic blocks:

.. code-block:: text

  Thread 1: A B C D F B D E F G
  Thread 2: A B D E F B C D F G

That is, both threads execute two iterations of the loop, but they execute
the different convergent operations in different iterations. Without forming a
relation between loop iterations across the threads, there is no reasonable way
of defining which dynamic instances of the convergent operations should be the
same across the threads, if any.

An equivalent issue arises if the convergent operations are replaced by nested
loops with loop heart intrinsics that directly refer to ``%anchor``, hence
the slight variation of the static rule about cycles that applies to them:

.. code-block:: llvm

  ; WARNING: Example of incorrect convergence control!

  %anchor = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  for (;;) {
    if (condition1) {
      for (;;) {
        %loop1 = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %anchor) ]
      }
    }
    if (condition2) {
      for (;;) {
        %loop2 = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %anchor) ]
      }
    }
  }

There is a cycle (closed walk in the CFG) that goes through both loop heart
intrinsics using ``%anchor`` but not through the definition of ``%anchor``,
so this code is invalid.


Examples for the Correctness of Program Transforms
==================================================

(This section is informative.)

As implied by the rules in the previous sections, program transforms are correct
with respect to convergent operations if they preserve or refine their
semantics. This means that the set of communicating threads in the transformed
program must have been possible in the original program.

Program transforms with a single-threaded focus are generally conservatively
correct if they do not sink or hoist convergent operations across a branch.
This applies even to program transforms that change the control flow graph.

For example, unrolling a loop that does not contain convergent operations
cannot break any of the guarantees required for convergent operations outside
of the loop.


Loop unrolling examples
-----------------------

An arbitrary loop that contains convergent operations *can* be unrolled if
all convergent operations refer back to an anchor inside the loop.
For example (in pseudo-code):

.. code-block:: llvm

  while (counter > 0) {
    %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
    counter--;
  }

This can be unrolled to:

.. code-block:: llvm

  while (counter >= 2) {
    %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
    %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
    counter -= 2;
  }
  while (counter > 0) {
    %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
    counter--;
  }

This is likely to change the behavior of the convergent operation if there
are threads whose initial counter value is not a multiple of 2. That is allowed
because the anchor intrinsic has implementation-defined convergence behavior
and the loop unrolling transform is considered to be part of the
implementation.

If the loop contains uncontrolled convergent operations, this unrolling is
forbidden.

Unrolling a loop with convergent operations that refer to tokens produced
outside the loop is also forbidden in the general case. Consider:

.. code-block:: llvm

  ; (A)
  %outer = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  while (counter > 0) {
    %inner = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %outer) ]
    ; (B)
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %inner) ]
    counter--;
  }
  ; (C)

To understand why unrolling is forbidden, consider two threads that execute
the same dynamic instance of the anchor and then proceed with 3 and 4 loop
iterations, respectively:

.. code-block:: text

  Thread 1: A B B B C
  Thread 2: A B B B B C

By the dynamic rule on loop heart intrinsics, these threads execute the same
dynamic instances of the loop intrinsic for the first 3 iterations, and then
thread 2 executes another dynamic instance by itself.

By the dynamic rule on general convergent operations, the threads execute
the same dynamic instance of the ``@convergent.operation`` in the first 3
iterations (that is, the dynamic instance executed by thread 1 in iteration
*n* is the same as that executed by thread 2 in iteration *n*, for *n = 1,2,3*;
the dynamic instance executed in iteration 1 is different from that in
iteration 2, etc.).

Now assume that the loop is unrolled by a factor of 2, which requires a
remainder as follows:

.. code-block:: llvm

  ; (A)
  %outer = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  while (counter > 0) {
    %inner = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %outer) ]
    ; (B)
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %inner) ]
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %inner) ]
    counter -= 2;
  }
  ; (C)
  if (counter > 0) {
    %remainder = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %outer) ]
    ; (D)
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %remainder) ]
  }
  ; (E)

First of all, note some interesting problems surrounding the loop intrinsic:

1. It is *not* duplicated inside the unrolled loop. This is to comply with
   the static validity rules in the :ref:`Formal Rules <convergence_formal_rules>`
   section.

2. It is unclear whether the loop intrinsic ought to be duplicated in the
   remainder, or whether the final ``@convergent.operation`` in D should just
   refer to either ``%inner`` (which is possible in SSA form) or directly to
   ``%outer``. The decision made here is arbitrary and doesn't change the
   argument that follows. Ultimately, it simply doesn't matter because the
   transform is incorrect either way.

The threads now execute the following sequences of blocks:

.. code-block:: text

  Thread 1: A B C D E
  Thread 2: A B B C D E

Analogous to the argument above, they execute the same dynamic instance of the
``%inner`` intrinsic and the ``@convergent.operation`` in the first iteration
of the unrolled loop, which corresponds to the first 2 iterations of the
original loop.

However, they execute different static calls to ``@convergent.operation`` for
the 3rd iteration of the original loop. In thread 1, that iteration corresponds
to the call in the remainder, while in thread 2 it corresponds to the first
call to ``@convergent.operation`` in the unrolled loop. Therefore, they execute
different dynamic instances, which means that the set of communicating threads
for the 3rd iteration of the original loop is different. This is why the
unrolling is incorrect.

On the other hand, if the loop counter is known to be a multiple, then
unrolling is allowed. For example, unrolling by 2:

.. code-block:: llvm

  %outer = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  while (counter > 0) {
    %inner = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %outer) ]
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %inner) ]
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %inner) ]
    counter -= 2;
  }

Note again that the loop intrinsic is not duplicated.

The
:ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.loop <llvm.experimental.convergence.loop>`
intrinsic is typically expected to appear in the header of a natural loop.
However, it can also appear in non-header blocks of a loop. In that case, the
loop can generally not be unrolled.


Hoisting and sinking
--------------------

In general, hoisting and sinking of convergent operations is forbidden. This is
because moving the operation to a different point in control flow generally
changes the set of threads that reach the operation and therefore, by the first
dynamic rule in the :ref:`Formal Rules <convergence_formal_rules>` section,
the set of threads that execute the same dynamic instance of the operation.
By definition, this changes the set of threads that participate in the
communication of the convergent operation, which will typically change its
result.

There are a number of exceptions, though most of them require additional
knowledge.

For example, hoisting and sinking across *uniform* conditional branches -- i.e.,
conditional branches where within every possible relevant set of threads, all
threads will always take the same direction -- is generally allowed. See the
end of the
:ref:`example of reductions inside control flow <convergence_example_reductions>`
for a brief discussion.

Some convergent operations can be hoisted but not sunk, or vice versa. A simple
example is the ``subgroupShuffle(data, id)`` operation. It returns the ``data``
operand of the thread identified by ``id``, where thread IDs are fixed and
assigned to each thread at launch. The result is undefined (or perhaps there is
UB, depending on the language and environment) if thread ``id`` is not in the
communicating set of threads. So hoisting is allowed in the following
pseudo-code example:

.. code-block:: llvm

  define void @example(...) convergent {
    %entry = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry()
    %data = ...
    %id = ...
    if (condition) {
      %shuffled = call i32 @subgroupShuffle(i32 %data, i32 %id) [ "convergencectrl"(token %entry) ]
      ...
    } else {
      %shuffled = call i32 @subgroupShuffle(i32 %data, i32 %id) [ "convergencectrl"(token %entry) ]
      ...
    }
  }

After hoisting the calls to ``@subgroupShuffle``, the communicating set of
threads is the union of the two sets of threads in the original program, so
``%id`` can only go "out of range" after hoisting if it did so in the original
program.

However, speculative execution of ``@subgroupShuffle`` in the following program
may be forbidden:

.. code-block:: llvm

  define void @example(...) convergent {
    %entry = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry()
    %data = ...
    %id = ...
    if (condition) {
      %shuffled = call i32 @subgroupShuffle(i32 %data, i32 %id) [ "convergencectrl"(token %entry) ]
      ...
    }
  }

There is no guarantee about the value of ``%id`` in the threads where
``condition`` is false. If ``@subgroupShuffle`` is defined to have UB when
``%id`` is outside of the set of communicating threads, then speculating and
hoisting ``@subgroupShuffle`` might introduce UB.

On the other hand, if ``@subgroupShuffle`` is defined such that it merely
produces an undefined value or poison as result when ``%id`` is "out of range",
then speculating is okay.

Even though
:ref:`llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor <llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor>`
is marked as ``convergent``, it can be sunk in some cases. For example, in
pseudo-code:

.. code-block:: llvm

  %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  if (condition) {
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  }

Assuming that ``%tok`` is only used inside the conditional block, the anchor can
be sunk. The rationale is two-fold. First, the anchor has implementation-defined
behavior, and the sinking is part of the implementation. Second, already in the
original program, the set of threads that communicates in the
``@convergent.operation`` is automatically subset to the threads for which
``condition`` is true.

Anchors can be hoisted in acyclic control flow. For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

  if (condition) {
    %tok1 = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok1) ]
  } else {
    %tok2 = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok2) ]
  }

The anchors can be hoisted, resulting in:

.. code-block:: llvm

  %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  if (condition) {
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  } else {
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  }

The behavior is unchanged, since each of the static convergent operations only
ever communicates with threads that have the same ``condition`` value.
By contrast, hoisting the convergent operations themselves is forbidden.

Hoisting and sinking anchors out of and into loops is forbidden. For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

  for (;;) {
    %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  }

Hoisting the anchor would make the program invalid according to the static
validity rules. Conversely:

.. code-block:: llvm

  %outer = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  while (counter > 0) {
    %inner = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ "convergencectrl"(token %outer) ]
    call void @convergent.operation() [ "convergencectrl"(token %inner) ]
    counter--;
  }

The program would stay valid if the anchor was sunk into the loop, but its
behavior could end up being different. If the anchor is inside the loop, then
each loop iteration has a new dynamic instance of the anchor, and the set of
threads participating in those dynamic instances of the anchor could be
different in arbitrary implementation-defined ways. Via the dynamic rules
about dynamic instances of convergent operations, this then implies that the
set of threads executing ``@convergent.operation`` could be different in
each loop iteration in arbitrary implementation-defined ways.

Convergent operations can be sunk together with their anchor. Again in
pseudo-code:

.. code-block:: llvm

  %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
  %a = call T @pure.convergent.operation(...) [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  %b = call T @pure.convergent.operation(...) [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  if (condition) {
    use(%a, %b)
  }

Assuming that ``%tok``, ``%a``, and ``%b`` are only used inside the conditional
block, all can be sunk together:

.. code-block:: llvm

  if (condition) {
    %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor()
    %a = call T @pure.convergent.operation(...) [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
    %b = call T @pure.convergent.operation(...) [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
    use(%a, %b)
  }

The rationale is that the anchor intrinsic has implementation-defined behavior,
and the sinking transform is considered to be part of the implementation:
the sinking will restrict the set of communicating threads to those for which
``condition`` is true, but that could have happened in the original program
anyway for some arbitrary other reason.

However, sinking *only* the convergent operation producing ``%b`` would be
incorrect. That would allow the (remainder of the) implementation to include
threads for which ``condition`` is false to participate in the same dynamic
instance of the anchor and therefore in the calculation of ``%a``, and so the
set of threads communicating for the calculations of ``%a`` and ``%b`` could be
different, which the original program doesn't allow.

Note that the entry intrinsic behaves differently. Sinking the convergent
operations is forbidden in the following snippet:

.. code-block:: llvm

  %tok = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.entry()
  %a = call T @pure.convergent.operation(...) [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  %b = call T @pure.convergent.operation(...) [ "convergencectrl"(token %tok) ]
  if (condition) {
    use(%a, %b)
  }
